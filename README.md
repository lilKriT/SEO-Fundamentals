Keyword Research: Find out what words people are inputting into SE.

How to choose keywords:

- Check if they keyword has search demand - by finding search volume
  But search volume can be misleading - it all depends on how many clicks you get.
- check traffic potential for the topic (total search traffic if you were nr 1)
  remember that you rank for more than 1 keyword. Top 20 pages for each topic rank for about a 1000 keywords
  trafic potential is a better metric than search volume. Traffic Potential - how much traffic the top ranking pages are getting.
- dont' choose keywords on traffic alone
- assess business potential of the keyword (value the keyword has to your business). Assign scores from 1-3 to your keywords. The higher the number, the more important it is. 3 means "buy your product", 1 means "what is your product". Just ignore 0.
- see if you can match searcher intent
- determine whether you can rank for your keyword (assess ranking difficulty)

Ask yourself: does the topic create enough traffic and have business value to make it worth the effort?

## Search Intent

Search Intent - the reason behind searchers query.
Matching search intent is a MUST DO thing.
You're not trying to satisfy google, but the searcher.
Identifying is easy:

- search the keyword
- analyze top ranking result
