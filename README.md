  they follow hyperlinks from those pages, and then crawl those
  then they bring it back to google
- ranking algorithm

Google Ranking factors:

- backlinks (links from a page on one website to another)
- search intent (the reason behind searchers query)
- content depth (answering your questions - not equal to length!)

# Keywords Research

## What are keywords and how to use them

Words and phrases people type to find stuff.
The foundation of Search Engines.

Keyword Research: Find out what words people are inputting into SE.

!Important
How to choose keywords:

- Check if they keyword has search demand - by finding search volume
  But search volume can be misleading - it all depends on how many clicks you get.
- check traffic potential for the topic (total search traffic if you were nr 1)
  remember that you rank for more than 1 keyword. Top 20 pages for each topic rank for about a 1000 keywords
  trafic potential is a better metric than search volume. Traffic Potential - how much traffic the top ranking pages are getting.
- dont' choose keywords on traffic alone
- assess business potential of the keyword (value the keyword has to your business). Assign scores from 1-3 to your keywords. The higher the number, the more important it is. 3 means "buy your product", 1 means "what is your product". Just ignore 0.
- see if you can match searcher intent
- determine whether you can rank for your keyword (assess ranking difficulty)

Ask yourself: does the topic create enough traffic and have business value to make it worth the effort?

## Search Intent

Search Intent - the reason behind searchers query.
Matching search intent is a MUST DO thing.
You're not trying to satisfy google, but the searcher.
Identifying is easy:

- search the keyword
- analyze top ranking result

3Cs of search intent:

- content type (blog posts, videos, product pages, category pages, landing pages)
- content format (mostly for blog posts and landing pages): how to guides, step by step tutorials, list posts, opinion editorials. For landing pages it can be a tool or calculator
- content angle (why someone should click) example: current year, for beginners, best price

## How to find keywords for your site

Keyword research: process of finding keywords that people are searching for
2 Macro steps:

- generate keywords ideas
- validate whether they are good

Keyword Research Tools:

- show you information on keywords
  - search volume
  - keyword difficutly scores
  - other SEO metrics
- they help you discover topics worth going after

Step by step:

- come up with a list of seed keywords (it's a broad keyword in your niche) (you can use free ahrefs generator)
- look at ahrefs tool
- look for trafic volume (you can use free ahrefs serp checker)
- look for business potential
- use keyword modifiers (for example add "best" "new" or "top" to a list of products)

Another way is to find what drives traffic to your competitors.

## Ranking Difficulty

Know your opponents are.
Pages that rank top of google for your keywords.

3 things to consider:

- search intent
- metrics of top ranks
- topical authority

### Search intent

Do the top sites fail to match search intent?
Do the url / title match the search query?

### Metrics

Number of websites linking to this page (aka Referring Domains)
Website authority (aka domain rating)
Aim to compete against pages iwth similar DR
You can use free ahrefs authority checker

### Topical authority

For example a website specifically about one topic will outrank other websites (even if their DR is higher)
To judge that? Look at the Domain Names and use common sense.

Ask your self if you can compete in the 4 areas. If you have more yes than no, go for it.

- Do the top sites fail to match search intent?
- you can get quality backlinks?
- can you get same or higher DR?
- can you get more topical authority than the comptetitors?

# On-Page SEO

Practice of optimizing web pages to rank higher in SE.
Revoles mostly around optimizing for search intent.
It also depends on creating and optimizing html tags and meta descriptions.

There's a lot of conflicting advice.

## On-Page SEO is NOT

- Stuffing exact match keywords (adding your keywords everywhere you can) - google understands connecting words, synonyms and closely related words. It usually leads to poor UX.
- using your keywords a specific number of times
- meeting a minimum word count

## On-Page SEO IS

- the goal of your page is to satisfy the searchers intent
- your content needs to address the things people expect to see
- nail items like:
  - Titles
  - Subtitles
  - Internal Linking
  - Readability
  - Content

## Optimizing for a keyword

You need:

- a page optimized to rank
- Backlinks

To do:

- Ensure your page satisfies searcher intent. (3C)
- Actual Content

### Content Aspects

What to write about?
Learn from your competitors.
If google thinks they are good, they must be doing something good.

You can use free SERP Checker.

- Look up your phrase.
- Pick top 3 relevant results. (keyword, relevant)
- Look for similarities between them. Not just the basic stuff (each page has a list and pictures...) but also more intricate. For example "All the products are aimed at beginners". This doesn't mean you MUST include them.
- Do a "Content Gap Analysis" before you start writing.
- Skim through the list and find an interesting subtopic

### Content Gap Analysis

It means "look for what the winners are doing that you are NOT doing yet". For example, what are all the top ranked pages using as keywords?

### Technical Aspects

- Include target keyword in your title when it makes sense
- Use short and descriptive URL slug. Using subfolders as categories is up to you.
- Meta description. HTML Code that summarizes your page. It usually shows up under SERP.
  They generally aren't used for ranking, but they can increase click through rates. But don't spend too much time on it, google rewrites around 67% of them.
- Add internal links to and from your page. Internal link is a link from one page to another in the SAME DOMAIN. Very powerful, they can pass link authority to other relevant pages. They help SE better understand page content. You can use ahrefs tools for that.
- Optimize images:
  - Name your images appropriately. Puppy > IMG 12332132123
  - Use Descriptive Alt Text. Puppy sitting on a couch > Puppy
  - Compress Images. You can use ShortPixel. I prefer Squoosh
- Optimize for readability:
  - Short sentences, short paragraphs.
  - Use Descriptive Subheadings.
  - Use a large enough font.
  - Avoid using big words.
  - Write as you speak. (Hemingway App can help)

Other optimizations:

- Open graph meta tags, aka OG tags - it helps with how your website looks on social media
- Schema Markup - it's how you are represented in Search Results.

# Link Building

The most important, and the most challenging SEO strategy.

Definition: Process of getting other websites to link to a page on your website.
Those hyperlinks are called backlinks.

Usually takes a long time. But worth the effort.
Don't try to make "friends" just to get backlinks. But your best backlinks will usually come from good relationships.

A better definition: Process of building relationships with other site owners who will want to add links to your website because it enhances theirs.

PageRank is used for that.
