Keyword Research: Find out what words people are inputting into SE.

How to choose keywords:

- Check if they keyword has search demand - by finding search volume
  But search volume can be misleading - it all depends on how many clicks you get.
- check traffic potential for the topic (total search traffic if you were nr 1)
  remember that you rank for more than 1 keyword. Top 20 pages for each topic rank for about a 1000 keywords
  trafic potential is a better metric than search volume. Traffic Potential - how much traffic the top ranking pages are getting.
- dont' choose keywords on traffic alone
- assess business potential of the keyword (value the keyword has to your business). Assign scores from 1-3 to your keywords. The higher the number, the more important it is. 3 means "buy your product", 1 means "what is your product". Just ignore 0.
- see if you can match searcher intent
- determine whether you can rank for your keyword (assess ranking difficulty)

Ask yourself: does the topic create enough traffic and have business value to make it worth the effort?

## Search Intent

Search Intent - the reason behind searchers query.
Matching search intent is a MUST DO thing.
You're not trying to satisfy google, but the searcher.
Identifying is easy:

- search the keyword
- analyze top ranking result

3Cs of search intent:

- content type (blog posts, videos, product pages, category pages, landing pages)
- content format (mostly for blog posts and landing pages): how to guides, step by step tutorials, list posts, opinion editorials. For landing pages it can be a tool or calculator
- content angle (why someone should click) example: current year, for beginners, best price

## How to find keywords for your site

Step by step:

Another way is to find what drives traffic to your competitors.

## Ranking Difficulty

Know your opponents are.
Pages that rank top of google for your keywords.

3 things to consider:

- search intent
- metrics of top ranks
- topical authority

### Search intent

Do the top sites fail to match search intent?
Do the url / title match the search query?

### Metrics

Number of websites linking to this page (aka Referring Domains)
Website authority (aka domain rating)
Aim to compete against pages iwth similar DR
You can use free ahrefs authority checker

### Topical authority

For example a website specifically about one topic will outrank other websites (even if their DR is higher)
To judge that? Look at the Domain Names and use common sense.

Ask your self if you can compete in the 4 areas. If you have more yes than no, go for it.

- Do the top sites fail to match search intent?
- you can get quality backlinks?
- can you get same or higher DR?
- can you get more topical authority than the comptetitors?
